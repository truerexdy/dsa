## Dir Structure
- Standalone algorithms and data structures are implemented in `algorithms` and `data_structures` directories respectively.
- `problems` directory contains implementations of solutions for problems related to DSA and CS
- `rexlib` is an attempt to create my own library containing my implementations of DS and Algorithms
